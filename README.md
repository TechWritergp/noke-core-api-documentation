 \* Before testing any code against actual locks, make sure that your mobile api key is set in the Nokē Mobile library. Also, make sure to implement the unlock call first as it also handles lock setup. If these two steps aren't done in the order specified there is the potential for losing lock keys which can result in bricked locks.

## Locks
---
### ```POST /lock/```

Used to view information about locks. Supports finding a single lock, multiple locks, or all locks associated with a company. Also supports finding locks by serial number or by both mac or serial number. At least one array must be present but both maybe included. Locks that fit either array will be returned.

#### Revoke Keys

When revoking keys please be aware that the revoked offline keys will still work on the lock until the lock is synced with the server during an online unlock event. In other words, if you are revoking an offline key to keep someone with that offline key from opening the lock it would be wise to go to the physcial lock and run an online unlock (via your app on an internet connected device) immediately after revoking the key. Additionally, if keys are reset on a lock the offline keys stored on a users device will no longer work on that lock, even if the user still has access to the lock in your database, until the offline keys on their device are re-synced.

### ```Quick Clicks```

Used to issue quick clicks for a lock or locks, revoke existing quick clicks, or view the status of any active quick clicks.  Quick clicks can be used to unlock the lock without additional hardware. 

#### Overview

A quick click is a code that allows entry to a lock via a series of long and short presses. This allows access to a lock without the use of additional software / hardware outside the lock once a quick click has been synced with a lock.

Quick click codes are represented as a string of 1's and 0's representing long and short presses respectively. The exact mechanism of how the quick click is used is dependent on the lock. For example, the standard padlocks use the shackle to enter quick clicks, while the HD padlocks and the U-Lock use a push button at the base of the lock. Typically, when entering a quick click, an LED on the lock will light up for a short press, and the LED will change color on a long press.

Quick clicks may be unlimited use, or may have a limited use count which is rendered unusable once the quick click is used a given number of times.

Quick clicks are created and removed via the API and are synced with a lock when an online unlock is requested. 

**IMPORTANT**:

* Each quick click MUST be a unique code. Quick click codes can only be reused once they have been removed from a lock.
* Quick clicks are only added to / removed from a lock via an *online* unlock.
* Each lock can hold up to 100 quick click codes.
* Quick click codes must be between 3 to 24 characters
* Quick click's can have a limited use count between 1-254 uses OR may be unlimited use represented by a use count of 255

#### ```POST /qc/issue/```

Used to issue quick clicks for a lock. This can either be to issue a new code or to update the number of times an existing code can be used.

#### ```POST /qc/```

Used to request all three quick click action types in one call. This request can contain issues and revokes, but will always be treated as a display call. This is because if no macs are included in the request for display, it will default to displaying ALL quick clicks for ALL locks. This has been the case in the past, but may have been a source of confusion. Also as a result of this, it is impossible to return information about successful issues and revokes in this combined call, but error-details will still contain details about failures.

It is likely that this call will eventually be deprecated and removed at some future time. Before that happens there will need to be some changes to the other calls such as allowing issuing quick clicks for multiple locks instead of just one at a time.

## Fobs

Fobs can be used to open locks without a mobile device and are particularly useful when a mobile connection is not available. When a fob is brought near a lock and both are awoken (by touching the lock button and pressing the fob) The fob will connect to the lock and provide the proper command and keys to unlock the lock (assuming the fob has credentials for the lock). The commands in this section enable management of the locks a fob has credentials for and the synchronizing of these credentials to the fob. 

Essentially, a fob is a storage device for offline keys. They use the same set of available keys on the lock though not the same individual keys. This means that the combined total number of offline keys and fob keys is 100. It also means that the caveats that apply to offline keys also apply to fobs. 

When revoking keys on a lock (the /keys revoke API call) please be aware that any of those removed keys that are stored on a fob will still work on the lock until the lock is synced with the server during an online unlock event. In other words, if you are revoking an offline key to keep someone with a fob with that offline key from opening the lock it would be wise to go to the physcial lock and run an online unlock (via your app on an internet connected device) immediately after revoking the key. Additionally, if keys are reset and synced on a lock, corresponding fobs will no longer work on that lock, even if the user still has access to the lock in your database, until their fob is re-synced.

Also be aware that when a lock is revoked from a fob this will also reset the associated key on the lock. If this were not done whoever had the fob would still be able to open the lock as long as they didn't get the fob re-synced. Thus when revoking a lock from a fob should also immediately re-sync the lock as in the previous paragraph.

For example suppose a lock has three keys A, B, and C. Also suppose that user Alice was issued an offline key on her phone using key A. She was also issued a fob with access to the same lock using key B. User Bob was also issued a fob using key C. Also suppose that Alice's phone can't access the internet while near the lock. 

Now consider this timeline:

| Chronological Events                                    | Alice with offline phone (key A) | Alice with fob (key B) | Bob with fob (key C) | Bob with online phone

## Activity

---
### ```POST /upload/```

Used to upload lock activity logs from a phone app using the  *Nokē Mobile library*. Requires a session string from the lock (*see [Nokē Mobile library documentation](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-mobile-library-ios#nok%C4%93-mobile-library-for-ios)*), a mac address, and can optionally take a tracking key to associate to lock activity. 


**NOTE:** this route uses a mobile api key rather than the private api key.

**NOTE:** also, this endpoint is called automatically by the Nokē Mobile library as long as the mobile api key is set

## API Versions

While we try to make most changes to the API backwards-compatible this is not always the case. In order to keep from breaking client code we have implemented semantic versions to identify the features/changes made to the API.

### API Version Response

This information is returned with all of the responses shown above. It identifies the version of the response, the available versions, and the default version used if no particular version is requested.

#### EXAMPLE RESPONSE

```json
    "api_version": {
        "response": "0.1.0",
        "available": {
            "0.0.0": {
                "changes": "",
                "status": "deprecated"
            },
            "0.1.0": {
                "changes": "Added ErrorDetails field in response which can hold details about multiple errors and is particularly useful when a request has multiple parts that can succeed or fail independently. Added API versioning. For qc/issue and qc/revoke added successes to Data field.",
                "status": "default"
            },
            "1.0.0": {
                "changes": "error codes/messages from quick click calls changing to be more descriptive and more standardized",
                "status": "active"
            }
        },
        "default": "0.1.0"
   }
```
|Parameter|Description|
|--|--|
|```api_version``` | Current information about API versions|
|```>response``` | The version of this response|
|```>available``` | A list of known API versions keyed by version number (versions are semantic in nature)|
|```>>changes``` | A summary of changes made in this version|
|```>>status``` | The current status of this version i.e. deprecated, default, active|
|```>default``` | This is the version returned if a specific API version is not requested|

### API Version Request

A client can specify which version of the API they wish to use with the following parameter added to any* of the above requests. If the parameter is not included in the request then the current default version will be used. 

As a reminder on semantic versions: 
* A change of the first number, major, indicates a potentially breaking change (feature or otherwise).
* A change of the second number, minor, indicates a new non-breaking feature.
* A change of the last number, patch, indicates a bug fix. 

Patch changes are informational only and requesting one specifically will not likely have any affect. In other words if you request 1.2.1 and a bug was fixed in 1.2.2 you'll still get the bug fix.

The same is likely true of minor changes. Since these changes are non-breaking (may add functionality but not modify or remove existing functionality) you'd may find these features' effects even if you request a lower version.

Major changes are those that remove a feature or change it in such a way that it might break something on the client side. This could be as simple as a change in error messages (in case some code depends on a specific string) or as complicated as replacing an endpoint with a new one. These changes are the ones that may require you to request an older version.

*Note that this is currently only enabled on quick click requests. It will be enabled on other requests as time and requirements permit.

## Firmware Update

Updating the firmware on a Noke device is a two-step process:

1. Put the device into firmware update mode
2. Send the firmware file to the device

### Firmware Update Mode

To place a Noke device into firmware update mode, make a request to the ```fwupdate``` endpoint. This endpoint functions similarly to the ```unlock/``` endpoint, but instead of unlocking the lock, returns a command that places the lock into firmware update mode.

### ```POST /fwupdate/```


Used to place a Noke device into firmware update mode. Requires a session string from the lock (*see [Nokē Mobile library documentation](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-mobile-library-ios#nok%C4%93-mobile-library-for-ios)*), and a mac address


#### HEADERS


|  Key | Value  |
|--|--|
|Content-Type | application/json  |
|Authorization | Bearer *api_key* |


#### BODY

|Parameter|Description|
|--|--|
|```mac``` | The mac address of the lock|
|```session```| Unique session generated by the lock and read by the phone when connecting. (*see [Nokē Mobile library documentation](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-mobile-library-ios#nok%C4%93-mobile-library-for-ios)*)|

```json
{
    "mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
    "session": "8675309j3nNy1V3G0ty0uRnUMB3r",
}
```

#### EXAMPLE RESPONSE

```json
{
    "result": "success",
    "message": "Command successfully completed",
    "error_code": 0,
    "data": {
        "commands": "COMMAND_STRING_HERE"
    },
    "token": "TOKEN_HERE",
    "request": "unlock"
}
```

|Parameter|Description|
|--|--|
|```result``` | String value representing the result of the call. Either ```success``` or ```failure```|
|```message``` | Readable description of the error|
|```error_code``` | Int value of the error thrown|
|```commands``` | A string of commands sent to the lock by the [Nokē Mobile library](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-mobile-library-ios)|
|```request``` | Name of the request|


### Sending the Firmware file to the Noke Device

Once the Noke device is in firmware update mode, the firmware can now be updated by sending it a new firmware file. Noke devices use a chip provided by **Nordic Semiconductor**, therefore we've found that the best way to send a firmware file is to use the DFU library provided by Nordic.

Please follow the instructions provided by Nordic to implement their library into your mobile application. The DFU library is available for [iOS](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-Pods-DFU-Library) and [Android](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-DFU-Library)

**Note**: The firmware files needed are currently not available to the public. To get the firmware file needed to update a Noke device, please contact a member of the Noke development team.
